We offer a wide range of products and services, and additional terms may apply. When you use Company's Services, you will also be subject to the guidelines, terms, and agreements applicable to that particular service (the "Service Terms"). If these Terms of Service are inconsistent with the Service Terms, the Service Terms will control.

## General Conditions of Use

By signing up to use an Account through any of the Mycelium Clients' social websites made available through the Mycelium Platform, you agree to comply with and be legally bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree to any of the terms set forth in this Agreement or any subsequent modification to the Agreement, you may not access or use any of the Mycelium Services and must cancel your Mycelium Account immediately.

We may amend or modify this Agreement by posting such amended or modified Agreement ("Revised Agreement") on the Mycelium Platform or by notifying you about the changes via email. Your continued use of the Services following the published updates to the terms will mean that you accept and agree to the changes.

To be eligible to use the Mycelium Services, you must be at least 18 years old (or the applicable age of majority and contractual capacity in each qualifying jurisdiction). By accessing or using the Mycelium Services you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older and you have full legal capacity and authority to agree and bind yourself to these Service Terms. If you act as an employee or agent of a legal entity, and enter into these Service Terms on their behalf, you represent and warrant that you have all the necessary rights and authorizations to bind such legal entity.

Mycelium disclaims any and all warranties, expressed, implied or statutory, in connection with the service which is provided to you "as is" and we provide you with no warranty or representation whatsoever regarding its quality, fitness for purpose, completeness, or accuracy.

The term "Mycelium", its domain names and any other trademarks, or service marks used by Mycelium as part of the Service (the "Trademarks"), are solely owned by Mycelium. In addition, all content on the website, including, but not limited to, the images, pictures, graphics, photographs, animations, videos, music, audio, and text (the "Site Content") belongs to Mycelium and is protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property or other rights. You hereby acknowledge that by using the Service, you obtain no rights in the Site Content and/or the Trademarks, or any part thereof. Under no circumstances may you use the Site Content and/or the Trademarks without Mycelium's prior written consent. Additionally, you agree not to do anything that will harm or potentially harm the rights, including the intellectual property rights of Mycelium.

We reserve the right to choose markets and jurisdictions to conduct business and may restrict or refuse the access of the Site and our Services in other countries or regions in our sole discretion.

Without limiting the foregoing, you represent, warrant, and covenant that you are not, and for the duration of the time you use the Services, will not be: (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties (including but not limited to the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, His Majesty's Treasury, and U.S. Department of Treasury), or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the United Nations, European Union, any EU country, UK Treasury, or the United States. If at any point the above is no longer true, you must immediately cease using the Services.

## Protocol

The Site is an interface that enables you to interact with Mycelium Chain, which is a layer 2 decentralised autonomous smart contract system deployed on Ethereum (the "Protocol"). The Protocol is comprised of smart contracts deployed on the blockchain network(s) that operate in a decentralised and autonomous manner. These smart contracts can be reviewed, verified, used, copied, modified, and distributed by anyone (subject to the terms of the applicable license). Accordingly, there might be other interfaces enabling interaction with the Protocol that we neither control nor are affiliated with. Furthermore, anyone can interact directly with the Protocol bypassing us and other interfaces. You should carefully and thoroughly review and assess the Protocol and related software before you use them, and any such use shall be at your own risk. You should always do your own research.

You further acknowledge that we do not control the Protocol, its underlying blockchain networks, and any software through which such network is formed. We only provide the users with the Website being an interface to access the Protocol. Accordingly, in no event shall we be responsible for or held liable in connection with the Protocol, underlying blockchain networks or software, their operation, functioning, implementation, or use, and you hereby assume and accept any and all related risks, including the risk of possible losses and damages that you may incur in connection with the use thereof.

## Accessing the Services

The Company grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the Services (information or software) on the Site in accordance with these Terms of Service and applicable Service Terms. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license, you may not:

- modify or copy the materials;
- attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on the Site;
- remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
- transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.

This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Company at any time.

You must keep secret all credentials associated with the Services. You are solely responsible for managing and maintaining the security of any information relating to such credentials and agree that Company shall not be held responsible (and you shall not hold us responsible) for any unauthorized access to the Services or any resulting harm you may suffer.

You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.

Your access to one or more Services may be contingent upon satisfaction of our onboarding processes, which may include verification of your identity and additional information we may request from time-to-time. The information we request may include, without limitation, personally identifiable information such as network address, name, email, address, telephone number, date of birth, taxpayer identification or social security number, official government-issued photo identification, and bank account information or other information we may reasonably deem helpful in satisfying our risk management or legal obligations. In providing this information to us you represent that it is accurate and agree to update your information promptly, but in no event later than 14 days following any change in your information.

## Disclaimer

COMPANY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL PROMISES, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DATA ACCURACY, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND/OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY COMPANY ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DIRECTLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANY END USER, AND THAT COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOU ONLY, AND NOT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANY OTHER PERSON. IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE NOT RELIED UPON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. WE DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT ACCESS TO THE SERVICES SHALL BE CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, OR ERROR-FREE.

You understand that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading from the Site will be free of viruses or other destructive code. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to our site for any reconstruction of any lost data.

Any statements and representations made by us or on our behalf, and any use of the tokens issued by us (the "Tokens") or of any platform, service or protocol upon which our Tokens operate (the "Project"), regardless of whether such Project is owned, operated, developed or otherwise controlled by us, shall be subject to this disclaimer.

The Project, while not owned, operated, developed or otherwise controlled by us, may be provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the Project is free of defects, vulnerabilities, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. Any use of the Project shall be at your own risk. In no event shall we be held liable in connection with or for any claims, losses, damages or other liabilities, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with the Project or its operation or use.

## Risk of Digital Assets and Decentralized Networks

Please note that all transactions involving digital assets or cryptocurrencies with a certain value that are based on blockchain or cryptography technologies that are issued and managed in a decentralized form involve substantial risks. You should therefore carefully consider whether using our Services is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to hold digital assets, you should be aware that the price or value of digital assets can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. Past performance is not an indicator of future performance. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any loss of your digital asset resulting from theft, loss, or mishandling of digital asset private keys outside our control.

We do not warrant or represent that the Tokens, the Project or any such related software are secure or safe, or protected from phishing, malware or other malicious attacks. Further, the Tokens, the Project and their related software may contain weaknesses, bugs, vulnerabilities, viruses or other defects which may have a material adverse effect on the operation of the Tokens, the Project or any such related software or may lead to losses and damages for you, other users of the Tokens, the Project or any such related software or third persons.

The Tokens, the Project and their related software are or will be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain main network, and later may be deployed on other blockchains. As a result, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of such blockchain(s) may have a material adverse effect on the Tokens, the Project or such related software. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the Tokens, the Project or such related software, and related blockchain software by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the blockchain.

The underlying logic of the Tokens, the Project and their related software may be flawed, defective or impaired, which can result in smart-contracts operating incorrectly or not as expected, or transactions being executed in violation of logic which underpins the smart-contracts, which can lead to partial or complete loss of digital assets used in the transaction.

We are not responsible for any digital asset market and we make no representations or warranties concerning the real or perceived value of digital assets as denominated in any quoted currency. Although we may provide historical and/or real-time data regarding the price of digital assets, we make no representations regarding the quality, suitability, truth, usefulness, accuracy, or completeness of such data, and you should not rely on such data for any reason whatsoever. You understand and agree that the value of digital assets can be volatile, and we are not in any way responsible or liable for any losses you may incur by using or transferring digital assets in connection with our Services.

Digital assets, blockchain technology, and any related software and services are subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty in the United States and other jurisdictions throughout the world. You acknowledge and understand that legislative and regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the usage, transferability, transactability and accessibility of the Services, the Site, the Platform and/or digital assets in general.

The information and descriptions contained in the Website are not to be construed as an offering memorandum, advertisement or prospectus. Accordingly, this information is not intended to be a complete description of all terms, exclusions and conditions applicable to the Services described in this Website. This Website and any information or materials contained in it do not constitute the distribution, an offer or solicitation of any kind to purchase or sell any product, security or instrument whatsoever nor should they be construed as providing any type of investment or other advice or recommendations by us, any of our affiliates or third parties to any person in any jurisdiction where such distribution, offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction. We do not provide investment advice and any content contained on the Site should not be considered as a substitute for tailored investment advice. The contents of our Site and the Services should not be used as a basis for making investment decisions. Before you make any financial, legal, or other decisions involving our Services, you should seek independent professional advice from an individual who is licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate.

## Know your Customer ("KYC") and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy

Mycelium is a permissionless, fully decentralized platform. As a software development company, Mycelium has no role in enforcing KYC by default, however, we do provide such tools for fundraising entities using Mycelium to enforce on their users, if the entities choose to do so. The use of KYC/AML tools on Mycelium by fundraising entities using the Service is completely at the discretion of said entities.

Although Mycelium makes no warranty as to the merit, legality, or juridical nature of any token (including whether or not it is considered a security or financial instrument under any applicable Securities Laws), token sale or fundraiser on top of Mycelium, we nonetheless understand the need of some token projects to require KYC/AML on their token sale participants.

Therefore, and at the sole behest of fundraising entities and/or competent regulatory authorities, Mycelium reserves the right at any time:

- To ask for any KYC documentation it deems necessary to determine the identity and location of a User.
- To restrict service and payment until identity is sufficiently determined.
- To share submitted KYC information and documentation to 3rd parties to verify the authenticity of submitted information, and the end-user (you) agrees to this by using the Service.
- To confiscate any and all funds that are found to be in violation of relevant and applicable anti-money laundering (AML) and countering terrorism financing (CFT) laws and regulations, and to cooperate with the competent authorities when and if necessary.

## Miscellaneous

Force Majeure. If by reason in whole or in part of any Force Majeure Event, either you or Company is delayed or prevented from complying with these Terms of Service, then such delay or non-compliance shall not be deemed to be a breach and no loss or damage shall be claimed by you or Company by reason thereof.
