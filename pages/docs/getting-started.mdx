# Get started with Mycelium

[![Mycelium Logo](/logo-mycelium-light.svg)](https://myceliumlabs.xyz)
Mycelium is a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain protocol purpose-built for Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and AI. A suite of tools that empowers developers, climate projects, and DAOs to create applications that contribute to ecological restoration, circular economies, and impact tracking—while leveraging the scalability and affordability of rollups.

Mycelium extends the vision of DeFi by embedding regenerative principles and AI agents at the protocol layer. But we don’t stop there; we believe the future of finance lies in intelligent, autonomous agents optimizing for both yield and impact. Mycelium is the first L2 protocol built specifically for ReFi, offering low-cost, high-speed transactions, composable ReFi primitives, on-chain data verification for impact projects, and modular infrastructure built for builders.

Everything is possible! Build Climate-focused DAOs and even smart contracts that measure and reward ecological actions, Mycelium is the home for builders and systems that regenerate as they transact.

## Why ReFi on an L2?
Regenerative Finance is the next frontier of Web3—going beyond DeFi to align incentives with ecological and social wellbeing. However, many ReFi projects face high fees, low throughput, and lack of composability on L1s.

Mycelium solves this by offering:
- Low-cost, high-speed transactions
- Composable ReFi primitives
- On-chain data verification for impact projects
- Modular infrastructure built for builders

## Why Mycelium?

The next evolution of ReFi isn’t just human-led—it’s AI-assisted. We’re building for a world where AI agents:

- Strategically allocate capital to impact pools
- Autonomously purchase and retire carbon credits
- Trigger regenerative incentives based on live environmental data
- Collaborate with other agents across chains and protocols

This unlocks a future where the ReFi economy scales beyond human speed, enabling:

- Smarter liquidity coordination
- Reduced manual intervention
- Trustless, verifiable ecological outcomes
